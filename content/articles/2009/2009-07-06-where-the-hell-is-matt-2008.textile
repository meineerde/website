During the course of updating this site onto its new technical basis (more on this later) I found a lot of old articles I wrote some time ago. One of them was "On Tour":/2006/08/12/on-tour/), featuring a video of "Matt Harding":http://www.wherethehellismatt.com/) traveling around the globe and dancing where he stops by.

In 2008 he made a new trip, danced again at various places, and made a new video. It's as good as the last one -- even with all that people around :)
