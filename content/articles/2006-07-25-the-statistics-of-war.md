>Here are some stark statistics:
>
> * Around 30 to 40 people are killed every day in the current Israel/Lebanon conflict.
> * About 100 people are killed every day in the violence in Iraq.
> * And 1,200 people are killed every day in the war in the Congo.
>
>All three of these stories are due to appear on tonight's Ten O'Clock News. They will probably run in that order - with the Middle East getting by far the most attention.
