So this is it. My next try of a content management system. Yes, again written from scratch. Yes, I know but Wordpress looks _not_ very sexy to me. And somehow I started to hate PHP while falling in love with Python, thanks to "Martin von LÃ¶wis":http://www.dcl.hpi.uni-potsdam.de/people/loewis/. So well, here we are...

This time I tested the magical powers of the Django ponies. It might be still rough around the edges and lacking some obvious features like a comment facility. But I'm certain that we will see some updates here soon. Once the codebase has matured a bit and the security-by-obscurity-factor is not _so_ important any more I will open source the system. Stay tuned.

But until then you can expect some more posts here. At least more than in the recent 18 month.
